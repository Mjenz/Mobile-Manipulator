# ME 449 Capstone Project README

## Software Overview:

The software in this project can perform kinematic task-space feedback control of a mobile manipulator using PI feedback control. The software can be divided generally into three main functions. The first function TrajectoryGenerator defines a desired trajectory for the robot to follow. This trajectory is defined by a set of key points in a pick and place task, and outputs the desired trajectory. Next, the function
FeedbackControl takes in the current position of the robot, the desired position, and the next desired position of the robot. Using simple PI feedback loop it generates joint speeds that minimize the twist error of the robot. Finally, the function NextStep uses odometry and a single euler step to calculate the next position of the robot. These three functions work together to simulate a robot control system, and output .csv files of the configuration during the task that can be played on CopelliaSim for visualization.

## Joint Limits:

One challenge presented was to use joint limits to avoid self-collisions and singularities. I decided to focus on using the joint limits to prevent self-collisions after testing revealed that some joint limits that prevented singularities posed more serious problems for the accomplishment of the pick and place task. So, I chose joint limits such that the arm does not bend backwards on itself to pick up the block. Meaning, I restricted the joint to around a -2 to 2 radian range (or smaller for other joints). This improved performance since the joint only operated in front of the chassis. During runs without the joint limits the mobile manipulator sometimes picked and placed the block inside of the chassis. The effect of my improvements can be seen in the overshoot directory where severe self-collisions occur without the intervention of my joint limits.Â 

## Code Changes and Helper Functions:

I changed the inputs and outputs to the FeedbackControl() function quite a bit from the suggested ones in the project description. This was for both practical reasons and for convenience. First, I had the function input and output the integrated error, so the value was carried through between iterations. Secondly, I changed the input of the current state to be the configuration rather than the transformation matrix X. I found it to be more elegant to input the current configuration (similar to the output of NextStep and the input to the .csv file) and then have this data converted to the X transformation matrix using my helper function get_transformation(). I also added a helper function get_jacobian() which retrieved the mobile manipulator Jacobian for each run of
FeedbackControl(). Another helper function testJointLimits() takes in the current next step configuration and identifies joints that violate the joint limits.This data is then used to modify the mobile manipulator Jacobian to prevent such violations and recalculate the joint speeds before finishing a run of FeedbackControl(). One last helper function odometry() performs all the odometry for the NextStep() function.
